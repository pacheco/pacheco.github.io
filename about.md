Currently, I'm a PhD student at the University of Lugano, Switzerland.

This is my personal website, where I intend to write about topics that I'm currently thinking about.

### Interests

I'm interested in the design and implementation of scalable and reliable distributed systems.

Some specific topics:
- Replication and consensus protocols
- Distributed databases and filesystems
- Geo-distribution
- Byzantine fault-tolerance
- Cryptocurrencies
